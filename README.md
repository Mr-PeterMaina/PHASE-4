## Business Understanding
* **Recommendation systems** are powerful tools that use machine learning algorithms to provide relevant suggestions to users based on behaviour patterns or user data.
* **A Book Recommendation System** is a recommendation system where we recommend similar books to readers based on their interests.
Recommendation systems help drive engagement, increase sales, increases revenue and this in return brings in loyal clients as the customer experience is elevated promoting customer satisfaction.
We have 2 main recommendation system models:
* 1. Collaborative filtering
* 2. Content-based Filtering

> BUSINESS PROBLEM  
* Over the past years, there has been rise in huge ecommerce and online services leading clients facing difficulty when searching for the right products.
* Clients looking to purchase books also face the same struggle when trying to match the right books with their taste and preferences.
* **The Business Problem** is to develop a recommendation system that recommends books that are tailored to our users preferences inorder to improve customer experience and engagement.
> PROJECT OBJECTIVE
1. To build a book recommendation system that provides personalized suggestions to our users.
2. Improve sales by showcasing books a user is most likely to buy.
3. Offer relevant books to users inorder to improve customer retention.
4. Increase customer engagement

The analysis aims to achieve these objectives by considering the following analysis questions:

1. *Which authors consistently receive higher ratings from users?*

2. *How does the year of publication affect the average ratings of books? Are newer books preferred over older ones?*

3. *How accurate are the recommendations generated by the collaborative filtering model especially in terms of precision?*

4. *How does class imbalance in ratings affect the performance of the recommendation model?*
